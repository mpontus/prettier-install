# Pretteier Install

[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is an opinionated code formatter which formats your code for you.

This package installs and configures prettier for you.

### Requirements

 * In current stage the script requires **Node 8+** to run.

### Usage

The simplest way to run prettier-install is by using `npx`.

Change to your project directory and ensure that your working tree is clean. Then run:

```bash
npx prettier-install
```

#### What happens now?

 * Prettier will be **downloaded and installed** to your project `devDependencies` using `npm` or `yarn` if available.
 * `prettier` **script will be added** to `scripts` section of `package.json` and will **run** immediately.
 * If you are already using eslint, [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) and [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) will be installed and added to the configuration.
 * You will be **offered to commit** the changes as a single atomic commit.<br/> *Hint: In vim you can abort commit by typing `:cq<Return>`*

#### What to do next?

* Verify that **glob patterns** passed to prettier allow it to reach all files that need formatting. Default is `**/*.js`.
* Review the **code style** applied by prettier. Review prettier documentation to see available [configuration options](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#options).

You can change glob patterns and arguments passed to prettier by modifying the `prettier` entry in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.

Run `npm run prettier` or `yarn prettier` when you want to reformat your code, or set up [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#pre-commit-hook).
